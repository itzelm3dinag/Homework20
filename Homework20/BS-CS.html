                <p>The goal of the project was to redesign a non profit website. We choose redesign child's play charity as we believed there was a lot of potential and we could help increase donations. This project was done as a class project. I worked together with in a team of three. I further iterated on all aspects of this project to make it my own.

        <p>We gathered user insight with a goal of understanding how people interact with charities and their potential pain points. We evaluated competitors to see potential opportunities for improvement. We took our findings and implemented a more clean and concise webpage. We presented this to potential users and continued to iterate.

                <p>We planned and conducted 3 interviews with potential users Followed that with affinity mapping to analyze results and pinpoint patterns We determined that 100% of people are interested in donating to charity. They are more willing to donate when organization is transparent in what they do.

                <p>We begun this effort by evaluating the current design and conducting Heuristics Evaluation. We noted opportunities for improvement in the following areas:</p>
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>Content: site contained a lot of information that was not easy to find or use
                    </li>
                    <li>Primary goal or purpose was not clear and website had inconsistent design
                    </li>
                    <li>Accessability: website has quite a bit of shortfalls when it comes to inclusivity.
                    </li>

            <p>In this project we gathered user insight with a goal of understanding how people interact with charities and fully understand potential pain points. We evaluated competitors to have an understanding of potential opportunities for improvement. We took our findings and implemented a more clean and concise webpage. We presented this to potential users and continued to iterate

  <!--Usability Testing and Findings-->

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 px-5">
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-4 text-center text-lg-left">Usability Testing and Findings</h3>
            <p>We conducted user testing on lo fi wireframes based on our findings we addressed three areas in our design
            </p>
            <ul class="mb-3">
                <li>Merch vs. Store: User confused what kind of store they would be directed to, associated "Merch" with items they would purchase to support charity
                </li>
                <li>Opportunities to donate: Add more buttons and links, make it very easy to donate at any point</li>
                <li>Share with Friends and Family: website has quite a bit of shortfalls when it comes to inclusivity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Usability testing consisted of pinpointing three tasks we would like users to complete. We had users make a donation, locate social media links and use navigation. We conducted the tests and recorded them. We then compared result from all tests pinpointed some commonalities and new ideas.

                <p>We continued to iterate on high fidelity wireframe based on user test results. We were able to reach goal of project by simplifying website so that both donations and were more accessible.

                <p>Looking back at this project there are some things I would like to improve. First this is to get a bigger pool of feedback for both user interviews and user tests. I would also go back and add additional questions to A/B test.</p>
